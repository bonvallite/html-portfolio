<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m <b>Jomar Rhandy Vallite</b> — a Full-Stack Web Developer with 8 years of hands-on experience in Shopify development and custom web solutions.</p>

<p>I started this journey with just one full-stack development course and never looked back. Today, I build everything from powerful Shopify storefronts to full-stack apps using:</p>

<p><b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps.</b></p>

<p>I specialize in:</p>
<Ul>
  <li>Custom Shopify themes & apps</li>
  <li>Headless commerce solutions</li>
  <li>Full-stack app development</li>
  <li>Blockchain integrations with Web3</li>
</Ul>

<p>I code with performance, scalability, and user experience in mind. Every line of code is focused on making businesses run better and grow faster.</p>

<p>Let’s build something great.</p>
